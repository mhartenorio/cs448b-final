  "Taylor Swift is one of this generation's biggest pop-stars. In her 15-year spanning career, she has managed to release 10 studio albums, six worldwide tours, and receive over 500 musical awards. Swift, one of the best-selling musicians of this century, is known for her genre-jump from country to pop and her success in both.",
  "In this project, I aim to analyze her musical work over her decade-long career through data. The analysis will be separated into three parts. In the first part, we will use Spotify-collected data to analyze audio features of her music. Following that, we will use sentiment analysis to investigate changes in themes over her career. Lastly, we will end with a lexical analysis of her lyrical songwriting.",
  "Through this data exploration, I hope that readers can get an insight on how she has matured as an artist and if there are any trends that make Swift’s music and popularity stand the test of time.",
  "First, we will start with an audio analysis of her work. We will use this dataset that uses Spotify API to gather a numerical value for each audio feature for each track. From ten audio features, we will isolate and explore five categories. We will explore each song’s acousticness, danceability, energy, valence (how positive or negative the song sounds), and loudness. To explore loudness, we will compare each album with a baseline of the least loud album. To gather values for each album, we will get each audio feature from each track and average them out per album.",
  "To interact with the visualization, you can isolate a trend line by clicking at any points on the line. You can see a more detailed track-by-track visualization per-album by choosing from one of the menu options."
